                I could be whatever you want. Anything a minute on either side of that and you're on your own. I could be pensive, uhh... smart, supersticious, brave? And I, uhh, I can be light on my feet. You just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna be that for you. There's a hundred thousand streets in this city. I wrote you everyday for a year. When you breathe, you inhale and you exhale, but every single time that you do that you're a little bit different then the one before. If I drive for you, you get your money.
